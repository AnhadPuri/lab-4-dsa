## Simple sorts

    * which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
    -> Bubble Sort. After performing bubble sort, we all agreed that it was the easiest to understand.
    * which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
    -> Selection sort seems to be the fastest as it swaps the element and places it to its right position which is sorted.

## Merging Unsorted lists

    * how long did this take
    -> 4 min 20 Sec
    * did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
    	* How many times?
    	-> 2 times then we revised false steps and got the correct ones.

## Merging Sorted lists

    * how long did this take
    -> 2 Minutes
    * did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
    	* How many times?
    	-> 0 times. As rows are sorted, it is less prone to errors and the first element of the row always picked out.

## Sorting larger data sets

| Team member      | Sorting time     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Anhad Puri | 6 min 43 seconds |
| Yogesh Attri | 7 min 3 seconds  |
| Lavakeshon Selvarajah | 7 min 50 seconds |

What was fastest time?
Anhad Puri recorded the fastest time that is 6 min 43 seconds

Describe how the team member sorted them.
started arranging the numbers by randomly picking and then placing the smaller number before the number and larger after the number making it sorted in the process.

## Partitioning

- how long did it take to partition the data set?<br>
  2 minutes 28 seconds

## Sorting the small piles

- how long did it take for you to sort all of the small piles?<br>
  it took 4 minutes to complete all 4 piles

## Putting it together

- As a team discuss things that helped soft the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do? What was slow?<br>
  The fasted way was partitioning and performing sort on the smaller piles, the slowest was bubble sort because the number of swaps that were needed to be done
- As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.<br>
  The best way to sort number on paper is to sort by partitioning and then using a sorting technique to sort the numbers.
- Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did. How long did it take?<br>
  The time taken by each member was comparable but personal abilities also account in those regards. The time was pretty close as both the team members did the partition between 2 min 30 sec to 3 min 30 sec and around the same time for sorting i.e. 4 min to 5 min.
